## Concept

This is project is designated as a learning project in the field of machine learning. The idea here is to use TensorFlow to train a model that can recognize a face as a female or male. This will also be in junction with opencv/tensorflow object detection to find the face in a video feed taken by a raspberry pi 3 camera. Once the gender has been detected, the pi will perform any action the user programs the device to achieve. I this case, the raspberry pi will open the top lid of a toilet seat for a female detected face. In the case of a male detection, the camera will open both lids.
